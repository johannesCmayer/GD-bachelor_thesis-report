\chapter{Further work}
In this section possible further applications based on the found data is discussed.

\section{Other directions with current state}
\subsection{Multiplayer Game}
2 Players are task to take observations of an environment that is rendered within the unity engine in a limited time. These observations  are now used as training data for a GQN. After training both player have to fight each other in this environment using the rendered output of the GQN.

\subsection{Merge output of multiple models}
\subsection{Blending of internal network state}
Lerp some parameters to network to create effect.

\section{Expand GQN capability}
GQN hard so not very good implementation. Variational metods, random ratent variables. Therefore only MLP.

\subsection{Generative model for modeling environment}
\subsection{Implement original GQN}
\subsection{Implement environment time step prediction}
\section{Expanded GQN directions}
