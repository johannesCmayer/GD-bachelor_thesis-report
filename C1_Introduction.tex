\chapter{Introduction}
Shrouded mirror is an experimental experience, where the player sees the world through the eyes of a neural network. The player has to move through an environment, collect checkpoints and avoids enemies. Each type of entity emits a unique audio signal, creating a distinctive soundscape.

\section{Motivation}
Using the representation a neural network has learned of an environment to present the environment state to the player, in an interesting way, is a nearly unexplored avenue. In this work I explore one way neural networks can be utilized in interactive experiences. I use a neural network that has learned how to  render an image of the environment out of a certain position and angle. The rendered images are then used as the main information stream presented to the player.

\section{Scope}
The following items where developed during the bachelor project:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Data generation environment}
\item{Data processing pipeline}
\item{Scene rendering neural network model and training pipeline}
\item{System to send network output to Unity}
\item{Merging of network output with unity rendered objects}
\item{Several exploratory prototypes}
\item{One extended Prototype (Maze game)}
\end{itemize}
