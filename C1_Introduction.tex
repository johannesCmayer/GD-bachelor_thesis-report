\chapter{Introduction}
Shrouded mirror is an experimental experience, where the player sees the world through the eyes of a neural network. The player moves through an environment, collects beacons and avoids enemies. Each type of entity emits a unique audio signal, creating a distinctive soundscape.

\section{Motivation}
Using the representation of an environment a neural network has learned, to present the state of an environment to the player is still an nearly unexplored avenue. 
In this work I explore how neural networks can be used to create a unique interactive experiences, by using the output the neural representation of the network produces as the main information stream presented to the player.

\section{Scope}
what has been done, what pices constitute the work?
During the bachelor thesis the following things where developed:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Data generation environment}
\item{Data processing pipeline}
\item{Scene rendering neural network model and training pipeline}
\item{System to send network output in Unity}
\item{Merging of network output with unity rendered objects}
\item{Several exploratory prototypes}
\item{One extended Prototype (Maze game)}
\end{itemize}
