\chapter{Reflection}
\section{Project}
The project has many flaws, list what did not work and how to remedy it.

\section{Workflow Evaluation}

Dont scale up model to quickly -> higher res, rotation on x axis. this makes itteration time slower (longor training) and lead to many other problems cropping up, that force patchy solutions.
