\chapter{Workflow}
The first step was to create a working implementation of neural network, that is able to learn
out of what iteration flows was workflow composed \\
Research, Implementation, Variation


\section{Prototypes}
Multiple protoypes explored:


\subsection{Functional}
prototype is used to develop the systems, especially for the neural net,
is able to learn from itputs what the skycolor is.

\dl{cimg('img of simple checker beard room with one sky color')}
\dl{cimg('another sky color')}


\subsection{Walking sim}
\dl{cimg('picture without object')}
\dl{cimg('img of the morphing center object')}


\subsection{Top down}
The goal of this prototype is, to test how well the network could be used to hide information in a simple top town navigation environment.
The idea is, that the network

\dl{cimg('img of top down, clear sight on platform')}
\dl{cimg('top down, blurry when not on platform')}


\subsection{Object morphing}

\dl{cimg('img of the morphing center object')}
